# Style_Guide_Project
This project consists of the code that I wrote in HTML and CSS in order to complete a project assignment on Codeacedemy, which requires creating a web page that shows the path of the design style (colours, fonts, buttons, badges, and text styles) that I'm going to use to create an online portfolio.
